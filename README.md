# Microservies-MSA

###  Springboot with Microservies 


#### N-Tier and monolithic applications used to be the de facto standard. In one single binary web artifact, like an EAR or WAR file, there would be a layered architecture with the decomposition of code into more functional components.

* Presentation Layer

* Business Process Layer/Service Layer

* Data Access Layer

#### There are several disadvantages to the n-tier monolithic application architecture:

* Tight coupling of code which makes changes hard.

* A single deployment with multiple layers that causes long testing, building, and deployment cycles.

* A big monolithic application that makes code reuse and sharing of components difficult.

* The Microservices Architecture (MSA) decomposes systems into discrete, individual, standalone components that can communicate amongst themselves, working together or with external systems.


** MSA is a more agile framework that fits well with the cloud-based world and lends itself well to web application development and web service development.**

#### MSA Features:

* MSA is very flexible because it supports any language that can communicate via a RESTful endpoint and leverages REST over HTTP.

* MSA offers agility and systems that are easier to write, test, deploy, and share.

* MSA provides systems that can better scale to load and demand.

* MSA provides systems that are resilient because failures are isolated and donâ€™t cascade through the infrastructure.

#### Eureka:

* Eureka, created by Netflix, is responsible for the registration and discovery microservices. Spring has incorporated Eureka into Spring Cloud, making it even easier to stand up a Eureka server.

* Eureka consists of a server and a client-side component. The server component will be the registry in which all the microservices register their availability. The microservices use the Eureka client to register; once the registration is complete, it notifies the server of its existence.


#### What make a microservice different from a normal RESTful service?

      A microservice must register itself with a discovery service
